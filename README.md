# JS-Calculator

I hope I can come back to this later as I grow better but If you love a challenge, there is some sort of a fail logic in this calculator. 
- The calculator doesn't seem to realize some people such as me may want to change an operation by pressing a different operator the second time 
- It doesn't recognize negative numbers or can't take negative flags yet and, 
- An operation like 6*-3 should equal -18

## Do not use the Eval() function to achieve this
